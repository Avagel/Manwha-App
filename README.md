## About

Manwha-App is a full-stack web application built to allow users to browse, read, and manage manhwa content in an engaging interface. The frontend is built in React, while the backend uses Node.js (likely Express) to serve APIs and handle data. The project is structured into two main folders: `Frontend` and `Backend`. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
